Dataset
Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.

Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets (Google dataset search, Kaggle, OpenSwissData, SNAP and FiveThirtyEight), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).
    
- Describing dataset, how many there is? Quality of data?
    

Problematic
Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.

What am I trying to show with my visualization?
Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

- Energy is a very important topic nowadays so we thought this could be interesting to have a visual representation of energy related data. 
- Comment sont réparties les énergies dans le monde ? Pays plus dvpés -> plus de green energy ?
- Permettre d'analyser plus facilement avec la carte comment améliorer les échanges de ressources énergétiques entre les pays ?

What others have already done with the data?
Why is your approach original?
What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

- One can choose more criterion
