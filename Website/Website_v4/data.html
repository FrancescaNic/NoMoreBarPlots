	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>
		We have chosen to focus on the dataset, <a href="http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx">Energy Statistics Database</a>, published by the United Nations Statistics Division on the UNData site.
		All data and metadata provided on UNdata website are available free of charge and may be copied freely, duplicated and further distributed provided that UNdata is cited as the reference.
		The Energy Statistics Database has 75 sub-datasets, each grouping information on specific energy fields, such as coal, biodiesel, fuel oil, geothermal, nuclear electricity, etc.
		It contains comprehensive energy statistics on more than 240 current countries or areas for production, trade, conversion and final consumption of primary and secondary; conventional and non-conventional; and new and renewable sources of energy.
		More precisely, for a certain energy statistic, these data provide:
	</p>


	<ul>
	  <li>Name of the energy statistic</li>
	  <li>Country or the area from which it comes</li>
	  <li>Associated year</li>
		<li>Quantity of that energy statistic</li>
		<li>Unit in which it is expressed</li>
		<li>Binary value that informs us whether that quantity is from an estimate or not</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The data has already been processed and cleaned, the only processing we will have to do on this data is to convert it to a format that suits us better as it is available in .xml format.
		This dataset is provided with an <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/questionnaire/documents/Energy-Questionnaire-Guidelines.pdf">annual questionnaire on energy statistics</a>, which provides detailed descriptions of each energy fields and statistics.
