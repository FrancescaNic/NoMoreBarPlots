[Milestone 1](#milestone-1) • [Milestone 2](#milestone-2) • [Milestone 3](#milestone-3)

## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

We have chosen to focus on the dataset, Energy Statistics Database, published by the United Nations Statistics Division on the UNData site. All data and metadata provided on UNdata website are available free of charge and may be copied freely, duplicated and further distributed provided that UNdata is cited as the reference. The Energy Statistics Database has 75 sub-datasets, each grouping information on specific energy fields, such as coal, biodiesel, fuel oil, geothermal, nuclear electricity, etc. It contains comprehensive energy statistics on the production, trade, conversion and final consumption of primary and secondary; conventional and non-conventional; and new and renewable sources of energy. More precisely, for a certain energy statistic, these data provide:
* the country from which it comes,
* the associated year,
* the quantity of that energy statistic,
* the unit in which it is expressed 
* and also a binary value that informs us whether that quantity is from an estimate or not.

The data has already been processed and cleaned, the only processing we will have to do on this data is to convert it to a format that suits us better as it is available in .xml format.  This dataset is provided with an [annual questionnaire on energy statistics](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/questionnaire/documents/Energy-Questionnaire-Guidelines.pdf), which provides detailed descriptions of each energy fields and statistics.

> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
