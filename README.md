## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

We have chosen to focus on the dataset, [Energy Statistics Database](http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx), published by the United Nations Statistics Division on the UNData site. All data and metadata provided on UNdata website are available free of charge and may be copied freely, duplicated and further distributed provided that UNdata is cited as the reference. The Energy Statistics Database has 75 sub-datasets, each grouping information on specific energy fields, such as coal, biodiesel, fuel oil, geothermal, nuclear electricity, etc. It contains comprehensive energy statistics on more than 220 current countries or areas for production, trade, conversion and final consumption of primary and secondary; conventional and non-conventional; and new and renewable sources of energy. More precisely, for a certain energy statistic, these data provide:
* the country or the area from which it comes,
* the associated year,
* the quantity of that energy statistic,
* the unit in which it is expressed,
* a binary value that informs us whether that quantity is from an estimate or not.

The data has already been processed and cleaned, the only processing we will have to do on this data is to convert it to a format that suits us better as it is available in .xml format.  This dataset is provided with an [annual questionnaire on energy statistics](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/questionnaire/documents/Energy-Questionnaire-Guidelines.pdf), which provides detailed descriptions of each energy fields and statistics.

### Problematic

Energy is a very important topic nowadays so we thought this could be interesting to develop a visual representation of energy related data. We also want to give a global and complete vision of the world energy network. 

What are the energy exchanges (production/consumption) between countries or even between continents?
Which types of energy are most present (produced/consumed), in which countries and the diversification over time?

In what areas are the different types of energy used? How does this evolve over time and how does it differ according to the wealth of the countries for example?
Are the most developed countries more advanced in the production of renewable energy?

How to improve and optimize the exchange of energy resources between countries?

We target audience in the following way: someone interested in knowing more about the energy network. The visualization must be adapted to an audience not educated on the subject. 
The idea is to have the audience discover the subject in its globally first, then to have an interactive format to deepen some points.

The main point of our visualization is that it will show a global graphical overview of energy related quantities and one can find more information by interacting with the map to have more detailed knowledge about specific data.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
